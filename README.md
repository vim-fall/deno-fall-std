A standard library for using [Fall](https://github.com/vim-fall/fall), a
Vim/Neovim Fuzzy Finder plugin powered by
[Denops](https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim). Users should import this
library to use the built-in extensions and utility functions.

## Usage

### Extensions

Extensions are available in the `builtin` directory. You can access them like
this:

```typescript
import * as builtin from "jsr:@vim-fall/std/builtin";

// Display all curators
console.log(builtin.curator);

// Display all sources
console.log(builtin.source);

// Display all actions
console.log(builtin.action);

// ...
```

### Utility Functions

Utility functions are defined in the root directory. You can access them like
this:

```typescript
import * as builtin from "jsr:@vim-fall/std/builtin";
import * as std from "jsr:@vim-fall/std";

// Refine a source with refiners
const refinedSource = std.refineSource(
  // File source
  builtin.source.file,
  // Refiner to filter files based on the current working directory
  builtin.refiner.cwd,
  // Refiner to modify item paths to be relative from the current working directory
  builtin.refiner.relativePath,
  // ...
);
```

### More Extensions

workflows, etc.), check out
